# This script performs two static analysis checks of src, first using Clang's
# scan-build program and the second using cppcheck. As scan-build integrates
# nicely into the build process, the code is also compiled. However, due to the
# extra analysis, this script can take some time to complete so it's best run
# infrequently, such as before a release.

# Please install clang-3.8 and cppcheck before running this script.
# If your distribution has clang-analyzer-3.8, you may need to install that as well.

# in some distributions the path is /usr/share/clang/scan-build-3.8/c++-analyzer
export CCC_CXX=clang++-3.8
export CCC_CC=clang-3.8

# delete any previous build as linking fails if there's a mix of compilers
