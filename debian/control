Description: Hidden service functionality for the Onion Name System
 OnioNS is a distributed, privacy-enhanced, metadata-free, and highly usable
 DNS for Tor hidden services. OnioNS allows hidden service operators to select
 a meaningful and globally-unique domain name for their service, which users
 can then reference from the Tor Browser. The system is powered by the Tor
 network, relies on a distributed database, and provides anonymity to both
 operators and users. This project aims to address the major usability issue
 that has been with Tor hidden services since their introduction in 2002.
 .
 This package provides the ability for a hidden service operator to claim a
 domain name and subdomains for their service.
